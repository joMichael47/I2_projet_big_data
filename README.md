# I2_projet_big_data
This repo concerns my academic big data project, the theme of which was transport. It involved processing the data with #PySPARK# , and doing descriptive and predictive analysis with the python #pandas library#.

The scripts in the 'explore_clean_usa_tranport.ipynb' notebook are used to explore and clean the dataset and create a new CSV file containing the cleaned and modified data.

NB: Running 'explore_clean_usa_tranport.ipynb' requires a suitable Docker environment (see part 2 of the report).

The scripts in the 'analyse_usa_transport.ipynb' notebook can be used to perform a descriptive and predictive analysis of the new dataset.
